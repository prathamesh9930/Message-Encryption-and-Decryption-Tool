🔐 Message Encryption and Decryption Tool

A simple, user-friendly desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library to encrypt and decrypt messages using Base64 encoding. Perfect for keeping your messages secure!

Prerequisites:-
* Python (version 3.x recommended)
* Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
* Base64 (used for encoding and decoding text)

Features:-
* Encrypt Text: Convert your message into an encoded format.
* Decrypt Text: Decode messages back to their original form.
* Password Protected: Access encryption and decryption only with the correct password.
* Easy Reset: Clear the inputs with a single click.


Usage:-
1) Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "Enter text for encryption/decryption" field.
2) Enter the secret key in the "Enter Secret key" field (default is "1234").
3) Click on:
   * Encrypt to encrypt your message.
   * Decrypt to decrypt an encrypted message.
   * RESET to clear all fields and start over.
  
🔒 Security:-
* This tool uses Base64 encoding for simplicity but is not intended for highly secure encryption. For stronger encryption, consider integrating libraries like PyCryptodome.
